## Risk Warning

Trading foreign exchange (Forex) on margin involves high risk and is not suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work both for and against you. Before deciding to invest in Forex, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. There is a possibility that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.
